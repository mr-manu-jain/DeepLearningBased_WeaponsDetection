# Automated Weapon Detection in X-ray Luggage Scans  
*AI-driven Data Analytic Track*

---

## üöÄ Project Overview
Security screenings rely on X-ray scans to catch prohibited items in luggage. Our project builds a deep-learning pipeline inspired by ‚ÄúOccluded Prohibited Items Detection: An X-ray Security Inspection Benchmark and De-occlusion Attention Module‚Äù to automatically flag weapons under varying levels of occlusion, material differences, and low-frequency occurrences.

**Key Challenges**  
- **Concealment**: Overlapping objects hide weapons.  
- **Material Variance**: X-ray appearance changes across metals, plastics, etc.  
- **Class Imbalance**: Prohibited items are rare in the dataset.  
- **Human Fatigue**: Long hours ‚Üí higher error rates.

**Our Approach**  
1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   - OPIXray & EDS collections, augmented with occlusion simulation.  
   - Versioned via DVC for reproducibility.  
2. **Model Architecture**  
   - DOAM backbone + focal-loss integration.  
   - Attack simulation (X-Adv) and multi-level occlusion (OL1‚ÄìOL3).  
3. **Evaluation & Testing**  
   - mAP, precision, recall & F1-score on adversarial and standard baselines.  
   - Grad-CAM heatmaps for interpretability.  
4. **Deployment**  
   - TensorRT optimization (<100 ms latency).  
   - Web UI with threat highlighting, validated on live airport scans.
